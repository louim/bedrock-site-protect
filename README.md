Bedrock Site protect
====================

This role is specifically crafted to go with [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis). It will allow you to set Basic authentication on your bedrock websites. This is especially useful during development if you have a staging environment that you don't want the world to see.

Requirements
------------

This role is made for Trellis (previously known as Bedrock-Ansible), so it depends on it.

Role Variables
--------------

The role will read from the `wordpress_sites` dict set in environments files of Trellis. It will search for the `htpasswd` key.

Example:
--------
<pre>
wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    site_hosts:
      - canonical: example.dev
    local_path: '../site' # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
    admin_email: admin@example.dev
    multisite:
      enabled: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
    cache:
      enabled: false
    <b>htpasswd:</b>
      <b>- name: user</b>
        <b>password: secret</b>
      <b>- name: user2</b>
        <b>password: secret2</b>
</pre>
You may want to add the `htpasswd` block in the `vault.yml` file so password will be encrypted.
You can also set the `htpasswd_path` to specify the folder used to store `htpasswd` files. The default is `/etc/htpasswd`. If you want to set this parameter, it is recommended that you set it in the `group_vars/all/main.yml` file, so it will be the same for all environments.


Dependencies
------------

[Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis).

Example Playbook
----------------

To get started, add this role (`louim.bedrock-site-protect`) to the `galaxy.yml` file in your Trellis installation like so:

```
- name: bedrock-site-protect
  src: louim.bedrock-site-protect
  version: 2.0.0
```

Then re-run the `ansible-galaxy install -r galaxy.yml` to install the new role. You might need to add the `-f` option to force install of previously downloaded roles.

You will also need to add the role to the `server.yml` like so:

```
roles:
  ... other Trellis roles ...
  - { role: bedrock-site-protect, tags: [htpasswd] }
```


Adding / Removing Basic Authentication
--------------------------------------
**To Add**: Run the Trellis command to set up your previously configured remote server: `ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=<environment>`
**To Remove**: Remove the following `htpasswd` block:

<pre>
  <b>htpasswd:
    - name: user
      password: secret</b>
</pre>

in the `wordpress_sites` dict set, and reconfigure via: `ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=<environment>`.
